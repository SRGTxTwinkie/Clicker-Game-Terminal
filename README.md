# ONLY WORKS ON UNIX SYSTEMS

I will update it when I get acces to a windows machine. The way the input system works only works on UNIX based systems. I have no way to test a windows version right now, so I can't see to make sure I make it correctly.

Im gonna add a shop and fix the leveling system.

It's kinda fun, but not really lol.

Fun to make though
